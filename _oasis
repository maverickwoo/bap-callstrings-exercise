# Note: With our current plugin system, there are two kinds of "Library"
# declarations. If you declare a normal library and use it in one of the plugins
# disguised as a "Library" here, you should (i) list the normal library in the
# "BuildDepends" field of the plugin as usual and (ii) add the library to the
# .mldylib file of the plugin. The second step is needed so that the library
# gets packaged into the plugin's cmxs.
